# Linking and Switching

## Summary

### Objectives
*By the end of this session you should be able to:*
* Compare and contrast LAN, PAN and WAN.
* Compare and contrast circuit and packet switching

### Key Points
* Computer networks can be split by size into
  * LANs
  * PANs
  * WANs
* Data over networks is split into packets and transmitted by one of two ways
  * Circuit switching, which reserves a pathway for a connection
  * Packet switching, which allows all packets to be sent over common pathways
