# IP Subnets

## Summary

### Objectives
*By the end of this session you should be able to:*
* Explain how an IP address is constructed
* Explain how and why IP networks are divided up into subnets

### Key Points
* IP addresses have two parts:
  * Network (prefix) bits: The first bits of the IP address that is assigned to an org, used to route packets to the network from outside.
  * Host bits: The last bits, used to route packets internally.
* Subnets allow organizations to split an IP block into smaller networks, while still appearing as a single network from the outside
