# Encryption

## Summary

### Objectives
*By the end of this session you should be able to:*
* Explain what encryption is, and explore the differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption
* Create a hand-computed, reversible encryption routine

### Key Points
* Encryption is the process of encoding information to make it unintelligible to anyone that doesnâ€™t know how to decrypt it
* Symmetric Encryption uses a single, shared secret that can be used to encrypt and decrypt information
* Asymmetric Encryption uses separate encryption and decryption keys which cannot be used interchangeably
* All encryption processes are algorithms, and anyone can make their own encryption algorithm
