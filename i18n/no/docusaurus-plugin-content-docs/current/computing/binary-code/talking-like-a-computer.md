# Talking like a computer

## Summary

### Objectives
*By the end of this session you should be able to:*
* Explain why computers use binary numbers.
* Demonstrate that computers can transmit information over anything that can represent two states.
* Explain how engineers measure the “size” of data on a computer.
* Explain how to measure the "speed" of connections.

### Key Points
* Computers use binary numbers because they have digital circuits, which can only represent two states.
* Computers can transmit data over anything that can represent two states, like an electrical wire, or a light.
* A binary digit is stored in a computer as a “bit”; 8 bits make up a “byte.”
* Data is measured in either multiples of bits (kilobit, megabit, gigabit), or multiples of bytes (kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte).
