# Coding flow

## Summary

### Objectives
*By the end of this session you should be able to:*
* Explain what control flow is, and how flow can be manipulated using:
  * For and While Loops
  * If statements
* Demonstrate common comparisons that can be used in control flow statements

### Key Points
* Control Flow comprises of the rules that tell a computer to do things conditionally and repetitively
* In code, programmers create:
  * Branching using if statements
  * Repetition using for and while loops
* We use comparisons to make decisions in Control Flow
